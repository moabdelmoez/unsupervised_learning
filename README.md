# Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data

### Here's some simple projects
1- K-means Clustering
2- Density-based Clustering
3- Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering
4- Principle Components Analysis - Eigenfaces project
5- Independent Component Analysis - Extracting the useful information from audio files
